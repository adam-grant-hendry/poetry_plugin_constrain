        * Explain what you are trying to do (_include a_ `gist` _link, if appropriate._)
        * Add links to documentation and/or examples (_show where you have looked_)

        Example:
          I am trying to do `xyz`. I am following [this example](https://www.example.com). [The docs here](https://www.docs.com/#page) lead me to believe I can do this, but instead `abc` happens. This has been discussed in [#123](https://www.issue.com), but it hasn't been or resolved or my issue is different because of `123`.
